Equivalent to npm init in GO

go mod init <module_name>

1. this is used to initialise a module
2. It creates a new file .mod in current directory
3. it contains info about the module, dependencies and Go version


similar to Nodeman we have 

go install github.com/cosmstrek/air@latest


create a file for configuaration


If this causes any conflict go for: 

go: downloading github.com/cosmtrek/air v1.61.5
go: github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest: version constraints conflict:
        github.com/cosmtrek/air@v1.61.5: parsing go.mod:
        module declares its path as: github.com/air-verse/air
                but was required as: github.com/cosmtrek/air



go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest

go does not have while loop?

go being similar to c -- pointers in code
